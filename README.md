# HOMEWORK-SPEI-2022-2023
Dipartimento di Economia e Management Corso di Laurea in Economia e Management Esame di Statistica, probabilità e inferenza – a.a. 2022/2023 Prof. Giuseppe Espa, Prof. Flavio Santi 
These are the solutions to the problems found in the homework assignment for the Statistics 2 exam given by Prof. Giuseppe Espa at the Trento University of Economics and Management. The assignment consisted of five exercises to be completed with the tools provided by the R programming language. These exercises summarize all the statistical skills (applied through the use of R) learned during the first and second statistics exams, which include: fundamentals of descriptive statistics and statistical inference (brief summary of the first exam), comparison between two groups, association analysis between qualitative variables, linear relationships, multivariate linear relationships, and logistic regression. 
This archive is designed for students who, like me, need to learn R and solve exercises like these. Wish u good luck!
